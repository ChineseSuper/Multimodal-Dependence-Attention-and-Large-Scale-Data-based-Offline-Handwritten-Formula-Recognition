# Multimodal-Dependence-Attention-and-Large-Scale-Data-based-Offline-Handwritten-Formula-Recognition
This includes the Handwritten Formula Image Dataset (HFID) introduced in the JCST accepted paper "Multimodal Dependence Attention and Large-Scale Data based Offline Handwritten Formula Recognition"

The **HFID dataset** is for handwritten formula image recognition to alleviate overfitting caused by lacking of training data. HFID consists of **26520** handwritten formula images with **404904** symbol samples for **156** symbol classes. It offers a large collection of handwritten formula images in real life. It is also worth noticing that not only the mathematical expression images but also the images of chemical equations are included in the HFID dataset.

The detailed composition of HFID is shown below:
